# Todo List

_What dose this do?:_ This is a Todo List checker that will allow the user to enter things
in which they wish to do and once they are finished doing a task, they can mark it off.

## Example

Bob has a lot on his plate for the day. He has to take the kids to school, pick up butter at the super market,
mail a letter, pick up the kds after school, then finally get home and fix up dinner. All Bob has to do is
type in a task and it will be added to a list. He can then mark off what he has already done.
